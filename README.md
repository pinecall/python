# pinecall

Build voice and chat agents as Python classes. Annotated fields are the agent's state, `@tool`
methods are what the model can call, docstrings are what it reads about them, and a Jinja view
renders the part of the prompt that changes during the call.

```python
from typing import Literal

from pinecall import Agent, state, tool

from clinica import agenda  # your own system: a CRM, an API, a database


class ClinicaNorte(Agent):
    """Eres la recepción de Clínica Norte. Hablas de usted, con frases cortas."""

    stage: Literal["identify", "book"] = "identify"
    patient: dict[str, str] | None = state(None, pii=True)
    slots: list[dict[str, str]] = []

    @tool(stage="identify", pii=("name", "phone"))
    def find_patient(self, name: str, phone: str) -> dict[str, str] | None:
        """Busca al paciente por nombre y teléfono. Pide los dos antes de llamarla."""
        self.patient = agenda.buscar(name, phone)
        if self.patient:
            self.stage = "book"
        return self.patient

    @tool(stage="book", preview=2)
    def free_slots(self, day: str) -> list[dict[str, str]]:
        """Horas libres de un día."""
        self.slots = agenda.libres(day)
        return self.slots
```

`views/clinica-norte.jinja`, beside the class, renders the prompt from that state:

```jinja
{% if stage == "identify" %}
Saluda y pide nombre y teléfono. Nada más hasta identificar al paciente.
{% endif %}
{% if remembers("médico habitual") %}
Ofrece primero las horas de su médico habitual.
{% endif %}
{% if slots %}
## Horas libres, en orden

{% for hueco in slots %}
{{ hueco.cuando }} con {{ hueco.doctor }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
```

The prompt has four named blocks: `identity`, `knowledge` and `tools` are static and cached
before the history; `view` comes after it and is replaced every turn. A block is re-sent only when
its text changes.

Memory and knowledge-base results never enter the prompt. The platform runs `recall` and `search`
and returns their results to the model as tool results, so retrieved text is treated as data, not
instructions. A view can ask `remembers("médico habitual")` and write its own sentence about the
answer.

## Five minutes

**Not on PyPI yet.** Until the first release, install it from this repository:
`uv add "pinecall @ git+https://github.com/pinecall/python"`. After it, `uv add pinecall`.

This package is a library: the verbs are the one `pinecall` CLI's, the same for every language. In
a project laid out as `agents/<name>/agent.py`, with this package in its `.venv`:

```bash
npm i -g pinecall                     # the CLI: Node, whatever the agent is written in
pinecall link                         # this folder tied to your org: its key, in ./.env
pinecall prompt --state test/<name>/goldens/a.json   # the exact prompt a state produces. No gateway.
pinecall chat                         # the agent served from this terminal, and a caller against it
pinecall test                         # ring 1: the goldens, scored by the gateway
pinecall start                        # registered and answering: the process you deploy
```

The CLI never loads your class: for `prompt`, `chat`, `test` and `start` it runs this package's
serve entry, `.venv/bin/python -m pinecall.serve`, and talks to it through the gateway. The
console, the knowledge bases, memory, keys and every other verb are the CLI's. How a server runs
the agent, with the CLI or inside your own Python process, is [docs/production.md](docs/production.md).

## Architecture

This package is the application side. It never talks to a model vendor or handles audio: it sends
commands and reads log entries over one WebSocket, in the runtime's own wire (`pinecall.wire`),
held to the runtime's golden call log. Tools and hooks are the only code that may change state.

| you want | you use |
|---|---|
| the class and the view | `pinecall.Agent`, `pinecall.bridge.mount` |
| the agent held inside your own process | `await pinecall.hold(ClinicaNorte, url=…, api_key=…)` |
| the socket alone, your own way of deciding what to answer | `pinecall.Client` |
| a suite with no network, no key and no model | `pinecall.testing` |

```python
import asyncio
import os

from pinecall import Client
from pinecall.wire.events import UserTurnEnded


async def main() -> None:
    pc = Client("https://cloud.pinecall.io", os.environ["PINECALL_KEY"])
    agent = pc.agent("clinica-norte")

    def heard(event, call):  # every turn.user of every call this socket serves
        if isinstance(event, UserTurnEnded):
            call.say(f"Le he oído: {event.text}")

    agent.on("turn.user", heard)
    await pc.connect()
    await asyncio.Event().wait()


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Testing it

Agent tests run with no network, key, model or gateway, in a plain pytest:

```python
from pinecall.testing import Gateway, load

ClinicaNorte = load("agents/clinica-norte/agent.py")

with Gateway() as pc:
    pc.mount(ClinicaNorte)
    call = pc.call_started(from_="+34600123456")
    call.tool("find_patient", name="Marta Ruiz", phone="600123456")

    assert "Saluda y pide nombre" not in call.prompt
    assert call.tools == ["free_slots"]
```

## Developing

```bash
uv sync
make check        # ruff, pyright strict, deptry, the suite and the example's own
```

## Requirements

Python 3.11+. Runtime dependencies: pydantic, Jinja2, websockets and httpx. The `pinecall` CLI is
a Node program (Node 24+): the verbs need it, the library does not.
